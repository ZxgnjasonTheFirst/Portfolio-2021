/*
    Features:
        -Not Implemented: none

        -Implemented: Ability to create a priority queue that has a priority from 1-10. The number with the highest priority is
        inserted first into the heap, and is the first to be popped from the queue.


        -Partly implemented: I do not know if the try catch for insert to prevent the vector from overloading works, returning a false
        if they catch an exception.

    Bugs     : no bugs

    Reflections: Pretty easy once you have the heap down it's just a matter of calling heap.
