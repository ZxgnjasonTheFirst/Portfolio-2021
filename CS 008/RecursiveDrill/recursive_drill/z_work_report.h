    Features:
        -Not Implemented: none

        -Implemented: Ability to execute programs all programs required in book: 9.1, 9.2,
        9.3, 9.4, 9.5, and 9.16.



        -Partly implemented: With R16_Guess when you're thinking of the number 1, it doesn't guess
        right away...

    Bugs     : no bugs

    Reflections: Very difficult, but a matter of putting things in the right place. Drawing
    it out helps. Also, note to self for recursive functions, local variables cannot be initialized
    for the recursion to carry over the value created in the function when it calls itself again.
