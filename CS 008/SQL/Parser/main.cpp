/*
 * Name: Jason Pambuena
 * Project: Database
 * Purpose: Stores records from a batch into a database created by binary files, maps, multimaps, and tables
 * and runs through a SQL class. ***Type in the batch file name to run this program.
 * Notes: Ability to have a file stay after running the program can be enabled through taking out the
 * filename variable pushing back the main file for files to delete in the SQL class.
