/*
    Features:
        -Not Implemented: none

        -Implemented: Took out any ambiguity with tokens, specifically between a period and a
        decimal point. The tokens can find punctuations, numbers, alphabets, and spaces, as well as
        unknown characters.


        -Partly implemented: Unknown characters are shown one-by-one, are not grouped together.

    Bugs     : no bugs

    Reflections: I was glad that I found a flaw in the design of the numbers state machin.
