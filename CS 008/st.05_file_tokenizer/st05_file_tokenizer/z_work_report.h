/*
    Features:
        -Not Implemented: none

        -Implemented: Ability to read all the ALPHA tokens of solitude.txt. ASCII characters with a
        value less than 0 is accounted for and is seen as unknowns.



        -Partly implemented: none

    Bugs     : no bugs

    Reflections: I feel that I would have never caught the ASCII table being less than 0.
