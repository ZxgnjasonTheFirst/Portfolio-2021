### Welcome to Zxgnjason's GitHub Page!

## Purpose
Currently I am enrolled in UCI to pursue Computer Game Science.
This page will serve as part of my [LinkedIn Portfolio](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jason-pambuena-129122133/), to help me get into –you guessed it– video game development!
The files presented here showcase the **_best_** of my Computer Science career.

## Experience:
So far I have experience in using C++, C# (Unity), and Python. 

## What I've Made
I've made several games, working with PyGame and Unity, a SQL Database (amongst many other Data Structures (like Hash Sort, Bubble Sort, etc)). 

## What's shown here?
The files showcased here consists of my experience with Data Structures, 
a PyGame Poker game, and the scripts for two collaborated 3D Unity Tank games: 
[This one](https://zxgnjason.itch.io/tankbattle) and [the other one!](https://zxgnjason.itch.io/tankarena)

## What I'm working on!
Currently me and my collegues have been assigned to create a visual novel this quarter (Spring 2021).
I'm also learning about Linear Algebra and its Computer Applications in Graphics.

## MORE STUFF!
A group of collegues and I also created a prototype of a Board Game through the help of TableTop Simulator called _Casino Night Thievin'_, while it doesn't showcase any code, it's definitely [worth looking at](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2474832863) (and/or worth playing!).
